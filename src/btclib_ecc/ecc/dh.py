"""Diffie-Hellman elliptic curve key agreement, per SEC 1 v.2.

Two parties, each holding the other's public key, compute the same
shared secret -- their key pair times the other's public point -- and
derive symmetric keying data from it through a key derivation
function. The curve and the KDF are the two things the parties must
agree on beforehand; SEC 1's KDF is `kdf.ansi_x9_63_kdf`, which
btclib_ecc.kdf holds beside RFC 5869's, and diffie_hellman is the agreement
built on it.

**Why `ecdh.shared_secret` of the bindings has no caller here, and this is the
place that says so** (issue btclib-org/btclib#909). That function multiplies and
hashes in one call, and the hash is SHA256 of the compressed shared point with
no way to change it: libsecp256k1 takes it as a C callback, so exposing it would
mean calling back into python from the middle of the computation. Every
ECDH-shaped computation here derives differently, so what is delegated is the
multiplication -- `ecdh.shared_point`, the same `secp256k1_ecdh` call answering
the point instead of its hash, and so the same `secp256k1_ecmult_const`,
constant time in the scalar. The derivation stays in python:

- `diffie_hellman` below runs SEC 1's ANSI-X9.63-KDF over the
  x-coordinate, under the hash function the caller passed;
- `ecc.ecies.derive_keys` hashes the *compressed point* with sha512 and
  cuts the 64 bytes three ways, which is BIE1's shape and not this one.

So the verdict is not that the function is wrong: it is that a shared
secret is a protocol's own derivation, and only a protocol agreeing with
libsecp256k1's default can hand the whole of it over. Neither of the two
here does.

    The shared point is a point that is not the generator multiplied by
    a secret, and on secp256k1 `ecdh.shared_point` of the bindings
    computes it here: `secp256k1_ecdh`, whose `secp256k1_ecmult_const` is
    constant time in dU, at a fraction of what the Python endomorphism
    path costs.

    `ecdh.shared_secret` of the bindings is a different function and not
    a substitute: it hashes the compressed shared point with SHA256,
    where this derives through ANSI-X9.63-KDF. The module docstring above
    has that verdict for both of this package's ECDH-shaped computations.

    Cofactor Diffie-Hellman (SEC 1 v.2, section 3.3.2) on a curve whose
    cofactor is above 1: QV is multiplied by the cofactor before dU
    multiplies the product, so a component of QV outside ⟨G⟩ -- one
    `bytes_from_point` still serializes, nothing here confining QV to ⟨G⟩
    the way `sec_point.point_from_pub_key` does -- is annihilated by h·QV
    rather than surviving into the point dU multiplies and leaking dU's
    residue modulo that component's order (issue
    btclib-org/ellipticcurves#15). h == 1 on every curve without a
    cofactor, where this is QV unchanged.

    `dU` is read through `curves.scalar_from_prv_key`, which validates it
    into 1..n-1 before either arithmetic arm sees it, so a bool, a float, a
    negative int or a value at or above `ec.n` is refused identically
    whichever arm ends up serving the call (issue
    btclib-org/ellipticcurves#10). `QV` is refused the same way on both
    arms when it is the infinity point: nothing here otherwise confines it
    to a serializable point, but INF is the one value neither arm can turn
    into a shared secret, and checking it once ahead of the dispatch is
    what keeps the two arms agreeing on it.
