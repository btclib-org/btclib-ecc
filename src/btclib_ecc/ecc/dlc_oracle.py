"""DLC oracle signatures: BIP340 with a nonce committed in advance.

https://github.com/discreetlogcontracts/dlcspecs/blob/master/Oracle.md

A DLC oracle announces the x-only point R = k*G of a nonce k before an
event, and signs the outcome with k once the event happens. The
signature is an ordinary BIP340 one, which `ssa.verify_` accepts.
Before the oracle signs, anyone holding its public key and R computes
the signature point s*G of each possible outcome with `sig_point_`, and
a DLC encrypts each outcome's transaction under it.

**A nonce signs one message.** Two signatures with one k reveal the
private key. That is why `sign_` lives here and not in `ssa`, whose
signers derive their nonce: a BIP340 signature that is not an oracle's
is `ssa.sign_`'s.

**The message** is BIP340's, of any size, signed as it is. The
specification's tagged hash of an outcome is the caller's to compute.
The curve, secp256k1, and the hash, sha256, are not arguments, as in
`btclib_ecc.ecc.ecdsa_adaptor`.

**Timing.** The key and the nonce go through `mult` and integer
products, as in `ssa`'s Python path; what `sig_point_` handles is
public and uses the `_var` arithmetic. Python here is not constant-time.
