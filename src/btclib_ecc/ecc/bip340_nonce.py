"""Generation of the ephemeral key (nonce) following BIP340.

https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0340.mediawiki

BIP340 derives the nonce from the private key, the public key, and
the message, all behind a tagged hash, plus auxiliary randomness a:

nonce = TaggedHash('BIP0340/nonce', t||x_Q||msg)
with t = q xor TaggedHash('BIP0340/aux', a)

Where:

TaggedHash(tag, x) = SHA256(SHA256(tag)||SHA256(tag)||x)

This is the synthetic nonce: the deterministic derivation is the
security floor -- with no randomness at signing time (a counter as a,
even all zeros) a nonce still cannot repeat across different messages
-- and fresh randomness is the hardening BIP340 recommends on top,
against fault injection and side-channel attacks. The key is masked
with the hashed randomness by xor, rather than hashed together with
it, to keep the number of operations touching the actual secret low.
The dedicated tag is domain separation: RFC6979 is not reused because
sharing a derivation (and a key) with deterministic ECDSA could leak
the key through nonce reuse across the two schemes. Any deterministic
derivation, BIP340 warns, remains insecure in multi-party signing.
