"""Everything this package asks of libsecp256k1, imported in one place.

The modules that delegate to the bindings import none of them directly:
they import from here, so the question "are the bindings installed" is
asked once, at one import, and answered by `INSTALLED` rather than by a
`try` block in each of them, which could drift apart. `ENABLED` is that
answer with `BTCLIB_ECC_NO_LIBSECP256K1` applied -- installed, and not
refused -- and `curves.curve` reads it into `_libsecp256k1_available`,
which is the seam every dispatch in the package consults, so an absent
binding is a dispatch that declines rather than an `ImportError` raised
before any dispatch is reached.

Two names because the seam moves and this import does not. `ENABLED` is
only the state `curves.curve` starts in, and `set_libsecp256k1_serving`
may have moved it since; `INSTALLED` is settled here and stays, so it is
what that function reads to refuse `serving=True` where there is nothing
to serve, and what the suite skips its `bindings` marker on. The
difference is this module's and the seam's, not a caller's:
`curves.is_libsecp256k1_serving` publishes one answer -- whether the next
call goes to libsecp256k1 or to the Python arithmetic -- which is the
only difference a caller can act on.

A module that imports nothing of this package but `exceptions`, and is
therefore below every module that reads it. What it imports from the bindings
is the whole of the surface this package uses, so this file is also the answer
to "what does this package need these bindings for", which no reader has to
assemble from the delegating modules' own imports.

The names are re-exported under the bindings' own spelling and the caller
aliases them as it always did: a caller holding `keys` and reaching
through it, and a caller naming `pubkey_sum` directly, both keep the call
they had. Neither shape costs an attribute lookup it did not cost before,
which matters where `curves.curve` counts tenths of a microsecond.

With the bindings absent every name here is None. Nothing may call one:
`_libsecp256k1_serves` is False in that configuration, and it is the
predicate in front of every delegation -- which is a rule about the
package rather than about this file, and is what `tests/no_bindings_test.py`
checks by importing this package with the bindings out of reach.

Absent and installed-but-too-old are different failures, and only the
first one is this fallback (btclib-org/btclib-ecc#25). `btclib_secp256k1`
itself failing to import is `ModuleNotFoundError` with its `name` naming
the top-level package -- nothing else is. A name this module asks for that
an installed, too-old package does not have raises a plain `ImportError`
instead (the package is found; the attribute inside it is not), or a
`ModuleNotFoundError` naming a submodule rather than the top-level package
(an old package missing a whole submodule this floor needs). Reading
either of those as "absent" is the defect: it is what let
`btclib-secp256k1` 0.8.0.6, which has no `btclib_secp256k1.ecdh.shared_point`,
answer `INSTALLED = False` instead of raising. So those two raise, which is
a loud failure at import time rather than a silent, slower fallback nobody
is told about.

What they raise is an `ImportError` that says what to do about it, chained
from the one the import system raised (btclib-org/btclib-ecc#56): the
installed `btclib-secp256k1` version, the floor this package declares for it,
and the two ways to a release that meets it. The floor is read back from this
distribution's own metadata, where `pyproject.toml`'s `secp256k1` extra put
it, so no second copy of it is kept here to drift; a source tree with no
metadata beside it is told to look in the extra. Only an `ImportError` naming
`btclib_secp256k1` or one of its submodules is taken for a bindings mismatch:
a dependency of the bindings that is missing, or a shared library that will
not load, propagates as it was raised.
