    What `mod_inv_var` is for an operand that is public, this is for one
    that is secret. The extended Euclid under that one takes the
    iterations its input asks for, and for an operand drawn uniformly
    below m what its duration carries is the operand's bit-length: on
    secp256k1's order a 256-bit scalar takes about twice what a 128-bit
    one does, falling at every step between them. That correlation is
    what the Minerva attack collects -- an ECDSA nonce is
    such a scalar, and a few thousand signing times sorted by it are a
    lattice away from the private key.

    (b*a)^-1 * b is a^-1 for every b invertible mod m, so drawing b at
    random leaves an inverse whose iteration count follows b and tells an
    observer nothing about a: 1.02x across the same range of operands,
    where `mod_inv_var` is 2.06x. What it adds is two multiplications,
    two reductions and a draw from `secrets`. Fermat's
    `pow(a, m - 2, m)` is the alternative and is flat for a different
    reason, its ladder running on the fixed exponent rather than on a
    random operand; it is not the one chosen, at 8.38x.

    The draw is what costs, so a small modulus pays proportionally more
    -- 4.8x on an order of 11, where the Euclid is a few iterations and
    `secrets` is the same syscall. Nothing signs with such an order
    outside the test suite.

    Not a constant-time inverse, and no more claiming to be one than
    `curve_group._blinded_jac` does: the duration is still an extended
    Euclid's and still visible, and what the blinding changes is whose it
    is. SECURITY.md publishes the Python path as variable-time, and
    CONTRIBUTING.md has what a name in this library does and does not
    promise about duration.

    m does not have to be a prime, and the blinding holds for any m.
    The factor's gcd with m, a second Euclid timed on the secret factor,
    is taken only when the product has no inverse: a factor that is not
    a unit, which only a composite m draws, is then redrawn, and an
    operand with no inverse raises. The expected number of draws is
    (m - 1) / phi(m). `mod_inv_var` is never handed the operand itself.

    What `mod_inv` is to `mod_inv_var`, this is to `mod_inv_batch_var`:
    the twin a secret may be handed. Montgomery's trick inverts one
    running product for the whole sequence, so the single extended Euclid
    it spends is timed on a value every element went into -- which is the
    channel, the same one and no smaller for being shared.

    Each element is blinded with a factor of its own rather than the
    sequence with one: `inv(a_i * b_i) * b_i` is `inv(a_i)`, and the
    product the batch forms is then a product of blinded values. One
    factor for all of them would blind that product and leave the ratios
    `a_i / a_j` in the peeled-back inverses, which is what the running
    products are made of.

    So it costs `n` draws from `secrets` and 2n multiplications on top of
    the trick, and the draws are the whole of it: measured on secp256k1's
    `p` over 16 random elements, best of nine alternating rounds, 2.1x
    `mod_inv_batch_var`, and the difference is what those draws cost.

    It is still the trick, which is the point of it being a batch at all:
    over the same 16 elements, blinding the batch is 3.6x cheaper than
    blinding one at a time, where the unblinded batch is 6.3x cheaper
    than the unblinded singles. The saving shrinks as the draws grow
    with n and the one Euclid does not; the trick still wins at every
    size worth batching.

    On a composite modulus a factor can be a zero divisor, and an element
    can have no inverse: either fails the batch, which is then answered
    by `mod_inv` on each element in turn, so the cost is at worst n
    independent calls.

    Not constant-time, for the reasons `mod_inv` gives at length. The
