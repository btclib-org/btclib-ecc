"""The package with btclib_secp256k1 not installed, which is a subprocess.

`btclib_ecc._libsecp256k1` asks for the bindings once, at import, and
`curves.curve._libsecp256k1_available` is that answer; so the question
this file asks -- does the package import and answer without them --
can only be asked of an interpreter that has not imported it yet. A
monkeypatch cannot: by the time a test runs, the import has happened and
its answer is bound.

Uninstalling them is not an option either, the suite being one
environment. So the bindings are put out of reach by a meta path finder
that refuses the name, in a child interpreter, and the package is
imported after that -- which is what `import btclib_ecc` does on a
machine that never had them.

This is not `test.yml`'s `no-bindings` job and does not replace it: a finder
that refuses one name leaves the wheel installed and the environment
resolved, where the job installs neither. What it does is make the
absent-bindings configuration answerable in the ordinary suite, on every
platform the matrix runs, rather than only where a second install exists.

What the child returns is compared with what this process computes with
the bindings in reach: agreement between the two implementations is the
property, and a child that merely fails to crash proves nothing about it.

`test_the_two_arms_refuse_the_same_inputs` asks the same question of a
refusal: the test above compares only what both arms compute
successfully, so it would not catch the shape of issue
btclib-org/btclib#1227 -- one input answered on one arm and raised on the
other, two answers decided by `pip install`. A second child, built the
same way, runs a table of inputs and compares what each arm refuses
them with.

`test_an_installed_but_too_old_package_is_not_read_as_absent` asks a
different question: not "is the package findable at all", but "is a name
this module asks of a *found* package missing". issue
btclib-org/btclib-ecc#25 is that the two used to answer the same way.
The meta path finder above cannot build that case -- it refuses to find
`btclib_secp256k1` in the first place -- so that child stubs the package
directly into `sys.modules`, present and one name short, and asserts that
what is raised says which version is installed and what to install instead
(issue btclib-org/btclib-ecc#56).
