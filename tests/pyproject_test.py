"""Each extra and the group beside it name the same requirement.

Section 1 of the organization standard: where a package is both an extra
and a group, the specifier is written twice, and a test refuses the day
the two disagree. The extra is what an install from the index resolves,
the group what every `uv sync` of this tree does, so a floor raised in one
and not the other leaves the suite running against a release no user is
asked to install.
