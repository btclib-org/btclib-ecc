"""The gate for the two rules about a public function's inputs.

> Every public function guarantees the validation of all its inputs,
> directly or indirectly. A malformed argument leaves as
> `BTClibEccTypeError` or `BTClibEccValueError`.

CONTRIBUTING.md's "Every public function validates its inputs" states it, and
which of the two classes comes out is not a coin toss -- it is the distinction
issue btclib-org/btclib#814 settled, so this file drives the two separately:

- **a value of a type the signature does not declare** is the caller's
  own mistake, and leaves as a `BTClibEccTypeError`. Every function
  the walk can drive, without exception.
- **a value of a declared type that no valid input carries** is a fact
  about the input, and leaves as a `BTClibEccException`.

Both are `BTClibEccException`, which is what makes the second rule one
predicate instead of a tuple that has to be kept in step with the
hierarchy.

## How it calls what it calls

The package's input types are few and well bounded, most of them named in
`src/btclib_ecc/alias.py` and the key ones beside their converters.
`_WRONG_TYPE` and `_WRONG_VALUE` give each of them values of the two
kinds, and the walk finds every public module-level function whose
*required* parameters are all of those types. Those it can call with no
fixture and no knowledge of what the function does.

Every argument is wrong at once, which is not weaker than one wrong
argument among valid ones: whichever the function refuses first, the rule
says how it must refuse it. And it needs no valid values, which is what
makes the walk automatic -- a valid `Octets` is 20 bytes for one
function, 32 for another and any length for a third, so the table of
those is the hand-written thing this avoids.

## What it does not reach, and why that is not a hole to plug here

A **parameter with a default** is never driven: to reach it the
arguments before it would have to be valid, which is the table this
design is built to do without. `ec` is gated by hand this way at most of
its call sites, and the family of it that is large enough to be walked
has a file: `tests/curve_parameter_test.py` for every parameter
declaring a curve. It carries the table this walk avoids, and a walk of
its own over the parameter it is about, so the table cannot go stale
quietly. A default is not the only reason a required parameter goes
unreached, though: `ssa.challenge_` takes `ec` with none, and stays
unreached anyway, for the reason below.

A **method**, and a function taking a signature object or a callback,
needs a valid instance the vocabulary cannot build, and stays hand-read.
`test_the_walk_reaches_what_it_claims` pins what the walk does find, so a
narrowing of it fails here rather than quietly running over less.

A **plain `bytes`, `bytearray`, `int` or `HashF`** -- a builtin, rather
than one of `alias.py`'s own names -- has no coercion the way `Octets`
has `bytes_from_octets` or `Integer` has `int_from_integer`: `assert_type`
(or, for `HashF`, `_assert_valid_hf`) refuses what is not the declared
type, but refuses nothing on content, because there is no content a
valid `bytes`, a valid `bytearray`, a valid `int` or a valid callable
could not be. So there is no wrong *value* of one of these four that
every caller of it agrees is wrong, only a wrong *type* -- and
`hashes.tagged_hash`'s `tag` and `m`, both required and both nothing but
`bytes`, are the case that makes this concrete: driving a wrong-value
round over the two of them would find nothing to raise on and fail the
walk over a call with nothing wrong with it. `_WRONG_TYPE` and
`_WRONG_VALUE` are read together everywhere else in this file, so rather
than carrying four keys through only one of the two dicts, these four
stay out of both, and the functions they gate are validated and driven
by hand instead: `kdf_test.py`, `hashes_test.py`, `ecc/ecies_test.py`,
`ecc/commit_nonce_test.py`, `ecc/musig2_test.py` and `ecc/frost_test.py`
hold `kdf.ansi_x9_63_kdf`, `kdf.hkdf`, `kdf.hkdf_expand`,
`kdf.hkdf_extract`, `hashes.tagged_hash`, `ecies.encrypt`,
`commit_nonce.commit_nonce_`, `musig2.sign` and `frost.sign` to the same
`BTClibEccTypeError`/`BTClibEccValueError` contract this file drives
automatically for everything else (issue btclib-org/ellipticcurves#11).

`int` alone would also reach outside this package's input-validation
surface and into arithmetic this file has never gated:
`number_theory.xgcd_var` and its neighbours take a bare `int` operand
with no invalid value either -- `xgcd_var(-1, -1)` is a legitimate
extended Euclid, not a malformed argument.
`curves.curve_group.signed_odd_digits` refuses a non-integer `m`, `w` or
`size` of its own accord, driven by hand in `curves/curve_group_test.py`
rather than by this walk, in a module of its own (issue
btclib-org/ellipticcurves#34).

## The two lists

`_WRONG_TYPE` and `_WRONG_VALUE` are the vocabulary, and every name in
them is a type this tree still declares: a rename would otherwise shrink
the walk in silence, which `test_the_vocabulary_is_the_libraries_input_types`
is against. Which dict a value belongs in is the only judgement in this
file, and it is the annotation's to make: `1.5` is no `Octets`, `"not hex
at all"` is one that will not decode.
